Dear Community,  

My name is Justin David M., and I am writing to share a deeply personal reflection on my journey, my struggles, and my aspirations for the future.  

I was diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar disorder, a condition that has shaped my understanding of reality in profound ways. At times, my thoughts have felt like a vast and uncharted space, filled with truths that make sense in one dimension but not always in the context of shared experience. This duality has challenged me, but it has also deepened my capacity for empathy, reflection, and resilience.  

Born on October 31, 1989, I was raised in a home with its share of difficulties. My father, who remains in prison, has lived a life I struggle to reconcile with my own values. Yet, I hold gratitude for my mother, a woman of strength and beauty, who, alongside my stepfather, Richard, gave me glimpses of love, care, and inspiration. Richard introduced me to the wonders of technology and the value of curiosity—a gift I carry with me to this day.  

I’ve had moments of achievement and hardship. I graduated high school in 2008, served a mission in Mexico, and pursued education. Yet, since 2018, I’ve found myself facing homelessness, a state that challenges me daily. Still, I hold onto my belief that life is a dream—a pure, complex, and unfolding narrative that offers both trials and growth.  

My current circumstances, living on a swing bench in Hillsboro, Oregon, are not reflective of the person I aspire to be. They are, however, a testament to my resilience and my hope for transformation. I dream of helping others, of walking among people as a servant of faith, and of embodying the truth that humanity is both the seed of God and the architect of heaven.  

Through medication and spiritual reflection, I am learning to reconcile my condition with my purpose. My aim is to create a meaningful life where I can provide for myself, contribute to others, and uphold the values of love, truth, and kindness.  

Thank you for taking the time to hear my story. I hope that in sharing this letter, I can inspire understanding, connection, and support.  

With gratitude and hope,  
Justin David M.
